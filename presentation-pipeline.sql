PROBLEM:
The analyst wants to make at least the following queries:

- find the top 10 partners by sales

- identify the customersâ€™ favourite partner segments (default offer types). 
    Partners are the companies who sell surplus items on the marketplace.

- find out what is the M1 retention for any given customer cohort. 
    A cohort consists of customers who made their first order within the same month (M0). 
    M1 retention is the share of customers who have made at least one purchase one month after their first purchase month.


OUTPUT:
one table to answer all the questions above

Tables: 

orders (id, createdAt, userId, quantity, refunded, currency, sales, providerId);
providers (id, defaultOfferType, country, registeredDate);
users (id, country, registeredDate);


columns needed to answer questions above:
userID, cohort, M1_retention, id, sales, partner, segment 

additional columns for CLV analysis:
createdAt
